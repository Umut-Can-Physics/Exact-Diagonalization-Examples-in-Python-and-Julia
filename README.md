# Quantum-Hall-Effect-In-Python
Hi. I created some useful examples in python about Computational Quantum Hall Effect. You can find this repositories:
- Plot of Hofstadter Butterfly
- Find Nearst-Neighbors of Sites
- Find Energy of Real Space Hamiltonians
- Kapit-Mueller Model
- Calculate Chern Numbers in Real Space
- Calculate Density Profile on 2-D Lattice
- Animate the Wave Packet Motion on 2-D Latice
